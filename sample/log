======== Working on chromosome 'chr22'
---- Processing individual SAMPLE
Using maximum coverage per sample of 15X
Number of variants skipped due to missing genotypes: 0
Number of remaining heterozygous variants: 1104
Reading alignments and detecting alleles ...
Found 2405 reads covering 1104 variants
Kept 2049 reads that cover at least two variants each
Reducing coverage to at most 15X by selecting most informative reads ...
